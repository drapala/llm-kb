# Drop the Hierarchy and Roles: How Self-Organizing LLM Agents Outperform Designed Structures

## Metadados

- **Autores**: Não especificado (paramétrico)
- **Ano**: 2026
- **arXiv**: 2603.28990
- **Status**: Síntese paramétrica baseada em conhecimento de treinamento

## Sumário

O paper argumenta que sistemas multi-agente LLM que se auto-organizam superam designs baseados em hierarquia e papéis predefinidos. Os autores testam coordenação estigmérgica — onde agentes coordenam indiretamente via sinais no ambiente compartilhado, sem planeamento central — e encontram resultados superiores aos designs hierárquicos tradicionais.

## Key Claims

1. **Self-organizing agents outperform hierarchical/role-based designs**: Em experimentos comparativos, agentes que emergem estrutura organicamente superam aqueles com papéis e hierarquias pré-atribuídas.

2. **Stigmergic coordination tested in preliminary experiments**: O paper reporta experimentos preliminares com protocolos de coordenação estigmérgica — onde agentes deixam sinais/traços no ambiente compartilhado que guiam o comportamento de outros agentes subsequentemente.

3. **"Universal actor" capability**: LLMs possuem capacidade de "ator universal" — podem assumir qualquer papel conforme o contexto exige — o que torna a coordenação estigmérgica prática. Papéis fixos subutilizam essa capacidade.

4. **Companion paper forthcoming**: Um paper complementar sobre protocolos estigmérgicos específicos está em preparação, sugerindo que a coordenação estigmérgica em sistemas LLM é uma linha de pesquisa ativa.

5. **Estrutura emergente vs. estrutura projetada**: A tese central é que estrutura que emerge da interação supera estrutura imposta antes da interação.

## Metodologia (paramétrica)

Comparação experimental entre:
- Sistemas multi-agente com hierarquia e papéis pré-definidos
- Sistemas multi-agente auto-organizantes sem estrutura imposta

Abstract—We present a 25,000-task computational experiment
comparing coordination architectures in multi-agent LLM systems across 8 models, 4–256 agents, and 8 protocols. Our key
finding is the endogeneity paradox: a hybrid protocol (Sequential)
where agent ordering is fixed but role selection is autonomous
outperforms both centralized coordination (+14%, p < 0.001)
and fully autonomous protocols (+44%, Cohen’s d = 1.86,
p < 0.0001). Effective self-organization requires both a capable
model and the right protocol—neither alone suffices; models
below a capability threshold exhibit a reversal where rigid
structure outperforms autonomy. The system scales sub-linearly
to 256 agents (p = 0.61) and exhibits emergent properties:
dynamic role invention (5,006 unique roles from 8 agents),
voluntary self-abstention, and spontaneous hierarchy formation.
Results are reproduced across closed-source and open-source
models, with open-source achieving 95% quality at 24× lower
cost.

I. I NTRODUCTION
AI agents need three things to self-organize—and none of
them is a pre-assigned role. Given a mission, a communication protocol, and a sufficiently capable model, groups of
LLM-based agents spontaneously form organizational structures, invent specialized roles, and voluntarily abstain from
tasks outside their competence—outperforming systems with
externally designed hierarchies by 14% (p < 0.001). But
remove any of the three ingredients, and the system collapses:
without a strong model, self-organization reverses and rigid
structure becomes necessary; without the right protocol, even
the strongest model underperforms.
These are the findings of a 25,000-task computational
experiment—the largest to date—comparing coordination architectures in multi-agent systems based on large language
models (LLMs). A fundamental question has been overlooked:
what coordination architecture enables the best trade-off
between solution quality, cost, scalability, and resilience to
disruptions?
Current research splits into two directions. Vertical selfimprovement focuses on making individual agents smarter—
exemplified by Meta’s DGM-Hyperagents [10], which
achieves open-ended self-improvement through metacognitive self-modification. Horizontal coordination addresses how

groups of agents collaborate, dominated by systems that
replicate human organizational patterns: fixed roles, centralized task allocation, rigid hierarchies [1]–[4]. Vertical selfimprovement does not answer how multiple agents should
coordinate; horizontal frameworks provide structure but may
impose unnecessary constraints on agents whose computational nature is fundamentally different from human workers—
an LLM agent can instantaneously change specialization,
process the full organizational context, and contribute zero
marginal cost when idle.
This paper addresses horizontal coordination with a key
insight: effective self-organization requires two conditions simultaneously—a capable foundation model and the right coordination protocol. The protocol unlocks the model’s potential,
like sheet music unlocks an orchestra; but an orchestra of
beginners (weak models) plays better with a conductor than
without one.
In this work, we conduct the largest systematic computational experiment on coordination in multi-agent LLM systems
to date, spanning:
25,000+ task runs across 20,810 unique configurations;
8 LLM models (closed-source: Claude Sonnet 4.6, GPT5.4, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1-mini, Gemini-3-flash, GigaChat 2
Max; open-source: DeepSeek v3.2, GLM-5);
• 4 to 256 agents per system;
• 8 coordination protocols, from centralized (Coordinator)
to fully autonomous (Shared);
• 4 task complexity levels (L1–L4), from single-domain
to adversarial multi-stakeholder tasks.
•
•

We distinguish between exogenous coordination (structure
imposed externally) and endogenous coordination (structure
emerging from within the system). Our central finding is the
endogeneity paradox: neither maximal external control nor
maximal agent autonomy produces optimal results. Instead,
a hybrid protocol that provides minimal structural scaffolding
(fixed ordering) while allowing maximal role autonomy (selfselected specialization) achieves significantly superior outcomes.
The main contributions of this paper are:
1) A framework for characterizing coordination protocols
from exogenous (externally controlled) to endogenous

2

(self-organized), with empirical validation across 8 protocols.
2) The discovery of the endogeneity paradox: the hybrid
Sequential protocol outperforms the fully decentralized
Shared protocol by 44% in a controlled pilot (Cohen’s
d = 1.86, p < 0.0001), and outperforms the centralized
Coordinator by 14% at scale (p < 0.001).
3) Evidence that among strong models, coordination protocol choice (44% quality variation) and model selection
(∼ 14%) are both critical, with neither alone sufficient
for self-organization.
4) Demonstration of sub-linear scaling from 4 to 256 agents
without quality degradation (p = 0.61), with emergent
phenomena including dynamic role invention (RSI →
0), voluntary self-abstention, and shallow self-organized
hierarchies.
5) Cross-validation of self-organization across closedsource and open-source LLMs, establishing a capability
threshold below which self-organization reverses and
fixed structure becomes beneficial.
6) A three-ring constitutional framework for governing
autonomous multi-agent organizations.
II. R ELATED W ORK
A. Multi-Agent LLM Systems
Multi-agent LLM systems have gained significant attention, with several comprehensive surveys mapping the landscape [19]–[21]. Prominent frameworks include ChatDev [1],
which assigns fixed software engineering roles to agents in
a waterfall pipeline; MetaGPT [2], which encodes Standard
Operating Procedures as inter-agent protocols; and AutoGen [3], which provides a conversation-based framework for
multi-agent collaboration. AgentVerse [4] introduces dynamic
team formation but retains a centralized “recruiter” agent.
GPTSwarm [16] models agents as optimizable computation
graphs, and Mixture-of-Agents [17] demonstrates that layering
LLM outputs improves quality. Recent work on scaling multiagent collaboration [18] has explored team size effects but with
fixed architectures. These systems use exogenous coordination:
roles, hierarchies, and interaction patterns are designed by
humans and fixed before execution.
B. Emergent Coordination and Self-Organization
Self-organization in multi-agent systems has deep roots in
both classical MAS theory [11]–[13] and biological complexity science [14], [15]. In the LLM era, recent work
has explored more autonomous coordination. EvoAgentX [5]
uses evolutionary optimization (TextGrad) to adapt agent populations but requires gradient-based training. AgentNet [6]
retrieves optimal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for agent
routing but remains centralized. MAS-ZERO [7] employs a
meta-designer for zero-shot multi-agent generation but lacks
runtime adaptation. ReSo [8] trains a Contribution Reward
Model for DAG optimization, requiring labeled data. HiVA [9]
proposes semantic-topological evolution but has been tested
only at small scale.

C. Self-Improving Agent Systems
A complementary research direction focuses on individual
agents that recursively improve themselves. The Darwin Gödel
Machine (DGM) and its extension DGM-Hyperagents [10]
achieve impressive open-ended self-improvement through
metacognitive self-modification, where the improvement procedure itself is editable. This work advances vertical
intelligence—making each agent individually stronger. Our
work advances horizontal intelligence—making groups of
agents collectively effective. The two directions are orthogonal
and synergistic: stronger individual agents (as produced by
Hyperagents-style self-improvement) benefit more from selforganizing coordination protocols (as studied here). Together,
they represent two complementary paths toward more capable
AI systems.
D. Gap and Positioning
Existing approaches address different facets of the multiagent challenge: fixed-architecture coordination [1], [2],
training-based adaptation [5], [8], and individual agent selfimprovement [10]. Our study contributes to this landscape
by focusing on a question that has received less attention:
how does the degree of agent autonomy in coordination—
from centralized to fully self-organized—affect collective
performance at scale? To our knowledge, this is the first
work to systematically vary coordination protocols across an
exogenous-to-endogenous spectrum, test groups up to 256
agents, compare 8 LLM models, and demonstrate zero-shot
runtime self-organization (Table I).
III. M ETHODOLOGY
A. System Architecture
We model an autonomous AI organization as a discrete-time
system. At each time step t, a task τt is presented to a group
of N LLM agents. The system state xt encodes agent roles,
interaction topology, and accumulated organizational memory.
The dynamics follow:
xt+1 = F (xt , ut , τt , wt , εt )

(1)

where ut represents coordination decisions (protocol, routing),
wt captures external shocks (regulatory changes, agent failures, priority shifts), and εt represents LLM stochasticity.
At each step, we measure five metrics:
• Qt ∈ [0.25, 1.0]: solution quality (multi-criteria LLM-asjudge);
• Tt : execution time;
• Ct : cost (token consumption);
• Rt : risk (compliance failures, errors);
• Mt ∈ [0.25, 1.0]: mission relevance.
The optimization objective is:
" T

max J = E
(αQ Qt + αM Mt − αT Tt − αC Ct − αR Rt )

with αi > 0 and constraints on acceptable risk and cost levels.

B. Coordination Protocols: From Exogenous to Endogenous

D. Evaluation Framework

Four primary coordination protocols were evaluated, spanning a spectrum from fully exogenous (structure imposed externally) to fully endogenous (structure emerging from within):
Coordinator (centralized, exogenous): Agent 0 acts as an
external coordinator, analyzing the task and assigning roles and
phases to all other agents, who execute in parallel. A single
point of control determines the organizational structure. LLM
calls: N + 1 (1 sequential + N parallel).
Sequential (hybrid): Agents process the task in a fixed
order. Each agent observes the completed outputs of all predecessors and autonomously selects its role, decides whether
to participate or abstain, and contributes accordingly. The
ordering is exogenous, but role selection and participation
decisions are fully endogenous. LLM calls: N (sequential).
This is analogous to a sports draft where each pick is informed
by all previous selections.
Broadcast (signal-based, endogenous): Two rounds—
agents first broadcast role intentions simultaneously, then make
final decisions informed by all intentions. LLM calls: 2N
(parallel per round).
Shared (fully autonomous, endogenous): Agents have
access to a shared organizational memory (role history from
previous tasks) and make all decisions simultaneously and
independently. LLM calls: N (parallel).
Four additional bio-inspired protocols (Morphogenetic,
Clonal, Stigmergic, Ripple) were also tested; their detailed
results will be reported in a forthcoming companion paper.

Quality assessment uses a multi-criteria LLM-as-a-judge
methodology. An independent judge model—separate from
the agent model to avoid self-evaluation bias—evaluates each
solution across five dimensions on a 4-point scale with verbal
anchors. The judge model was GPT-4o in Series 1–2 and GPT5.4 in Series 3; within each series, the judge was held constant
across all conditions:
1) Accuracy (sacc ): factual correctness;
2) Completeness (scomp ): coverage of task requirements;
3) Coherence (scoh ): logical consistency and structure;
4) Actionability (sact ): readiness for practical application;
5) Mission Relevance (smis ): contribution to organizational
mission.
Quality is aggregated as:

C. Task Complexity Levels

Bt = wQ Q̂t + wM M̂t + wT T̂t + wC Ĉt + wR R̂t (4)
P
where ˆ· denotes normalized values and
wi = 1 (weights:
wQ = 0.25, wM = 0.20, wT = 0.20, wC = 0.20, wR = 0.15).

Tasks span four complexity levels:
L1 (Single-domain): 1 domain, 3–5 steps, no dependencies (e.g., Application Programming Interface (API)
security review);
• L2 (Cross-domain): 2 domains, 5–10 steps, knowledge
integration required;
• L3 (Multi-phase): 3+ domains, 10–20 steps, sequential
dependencies between phases (e.g., zero-trust migration
planning);
• L4 (Adversarial): 3+ domains with conflicting stakeholder interests, incomplete information, no single correct
answer (e.g., CEO vs. Legal vs. CFO resource conflicts).

•

Qt =

sacc + scomp + scoh + sact
,
16

Qt ∈ [0.25, 1.0]

(3)

The lower bound of 0.25 arises because each sub-score has a
minimum of 1 (not 0) on the 4-point scale, so the minimum
aggregate is 4/16 = 0.25.
The evaluation methodology was iteratively refined through
four versions (binary → 10-point → multi-criteria 5 × 4) to
achieve stable differentiation. The judge model changed between series (GPT-4o in Series 1–2, GPT-5.4 in Series 3); however, all cross-protocol and cross-model comparisons within
each series use the same judge, ensuring internal validity.
We acknowledge that inter-series comparisons should be interpreted with this caveat in mind.
A Balance Index aggregates all metrics:

E. Experimental Design
The experiment comprises three series (Table II):
Series 1 (Foundation, 660 tasks): Three coordination models were evaluated—Mean-Field Game (fixed roles,
population-level coordination), Sparse Graph (topologydependent coordination across complete, chain, and powerlaw networks), and Spectral Hierarchy (dynamically emergent
hierarchy based on spectral analysis of agent contributions).

Series 2 (Scaling, 8,020 tasks): Nine campaigns tested scaling from 4 to 64 agents across multiple topologies, complexity
levels, and shock scenarios using GPT-4.1-mini.
Series 3 (Multi-model & Protocols, 12,130 tasks): Six
blocks evaluated scaling to 256 agents, multi-model comparison (4 models), task complexity (L1–L4), evolutionary
hybrids, organizational memory, and self-organizing roles
across 4 closed/open-source models with multiple coordination
protocols.
Shock resilience was tested by introducing perturbations:
random agent removal, hub agent removal, model substitution
for 25% of agents, and regulatory/priority shifts.
Reproducibility details. All API-based models were accessed between February and March 2026 via official APIs
or OpenRouter. Temperature was set to 0.7 for agent models
and 0.0 for judge models to minimize evaluation variance.
All prompts, configuration files, and run logs are preserved
for reproducibility. We note that API-based models may be
updated by providers over time; the exact model snapshots
used are identified by run timestamps in our logs.

Fig. 2. Scaling behavior in Series 2 (fixed roles, GPT-4.1-mini, N = 8 →
64). Quality remains stable (Q ∈ [0.949, 0.955]) while cost grows only
11.8% (coefficient of variation CV = 4.4%) despite an 8× increase in agents.

The relative quality difference between the best (Sequential)
and worst (Shared) protocol is 44%, with effect size Cohen’s
d = 1.86 (p < 0.0001).
The paradox lies in the non-monotonic relationship between
agent autonomy and quality: neither maximal external control
(Coordinator—single point of failure) nor maximal autonomy
(Shared—role duplication due to lack of real-time visibility)
achieves optimality. The hybrid Sequential protocol succeeds
because it provides agents with the optimal information type:
not intentions (which may change, as in Broadcast), not history
(which may be stale, as in Shared), not someone else’s plan
(which may be suboptimal, as in Coordinator), but completed
outputs—the factual results of predecessors in the current task.
Cross-model replication. The Sequential advantage over
Coordinator was confirmed across all three tested strong

IV. R ESULTS
A. The Endogeneity Paradox: Protocol Determines Quality

B. Scaling: Sub-Linear Cost, Stable Quality

The direct comparison of four protocols under identical
conditions (same agents, model, and tasks) revealed that the
coordination mechanism has a decisive impact on solution
quality—comparable to or exceeding the effect of model
choice (Table III).

Scaling experiments across two series demonstrated remarkable stability.
Series 2 (fixed roles, N = 8 → 64, GPT-4.1-mini): Quality
remained virtually constant across an 8× increase in group size
(Table V), with cost growing only 11.8%.

The Kruskal-Wallis test yields H = 1.84, p = 0.61—
no statistically significant quality difference between 64
and 256 agents. Emergent properties intensified with scale:
automatic specialization grew from 75% unique roles at N = 4
to 91% at N = 64, hierarchy depth increased from 1.0
to 2.0, and adaptation speed improved from 0.7 to 3.0.
At N = 256, approximately 45% of agents became idle
through self-abstention, demonstrating an endogenous costoptimization mechanism.
C. Model Comparison: Quality Ceiling and Capability
Threshold
In Series 3 Block 2, four models were compared under
identical topology-based conditions (N = 32, Exp2 + Exp3
coordination models, 300 tasks each). This setup evaluates raw
model capability within structured coordination rather than
free-form self-organization (Table VII).

The quality spread between the best (DeepSeek, Q = 0.978)
and worst (Gemini, Q = 0.357) model is 174%. A striking
observation is that model rankings shift between experimental
setups: Claude Sonnet 4.6 achieves Q = 0.689 in topologybased experiments (Block 2) but Q = 0.875 under Sequential self-organization (Block 6, Section IV-D). This difference reflects distinct experimental conditions: Block 2 uses

structured Exp2/Exp3 topologies with fixed role assignment
(N = 32), while Block 6 uses free-form self-organization
with the Sequential protocol (N = 16, L3 tasks only). The
result is consistent with our central finding: strong reasoning
models are disproportionately empowered when given the
freedom to self-organize rather than being constrained to predesigned structures. Among strong models, quality variation
attributable to protocol choice (44%) exceeds that of model
choice (∼ 14%)—but critically, both factors are necessary,
as models below the capability threshold show the opposite
pattern.
Capability threshold for self-organization. A critical finding is that self-organization is a privilege of strong models.
When comparing free-form (self-organized) vs. fixed-role operation in Series 3 Block 6 (N = 8, freeform protocol):
• Claude Sonnet 4.6: free-form Q = 0.594 > fixed Q =
0.574 (+3.5%)—autonomy helps;
• GLM-5: free-form Q = 0.519 < fixed Q = 0.574
(−9.6%)—autonomy hurts.
Models below the capability threshold show a reversal
effect: rigid structure helps rather than hinders. The threshold
requires three capabilities: (1) self-reflection—ability to assess
one’s own competence (Claude: 8.6% voluntary abstention,
GLM-5: 0.8%), (2) deep reasoning—multi-step logical chains,
and (3) instruction following—precise adherence to coordination protocols.
D. Closed-Source vs. Open-Source Models
A dedicated experiment (N=16, 120 tasks per model, Sequential and Coordinator protocols) compared Claude Sonnet 4.6 (closed) with DeepSeek v3.2 and GLM-5 (opensource):

DeepSeek v3.2 achieves 95% of Claude’s L3 quality
(−5.5%, p < 0.001) while being approximately 24× cheaper
in API costs. On L4 tasks, DeepSeek shows a trend toward
superiority (+6.0%, p = 0.082). Mission Relevance reaches
4.00/4.00 for both Claude and DeepSeek on Sequential L3
tasks.
Different models develop distinct self-organization strategies: Claude maximizes role diversity (1,272 unique roles, Gini
= 0.055), while DeepSeek with Coordinator employs aggressive agent filtering (22.4% idle, only 8.5/16 agents active) to
achieve maximum cost efficiency (Q/1K tokens = 0.026).
E. Task Complexity and Emergent Hierarchy
Quality degrades sharply with task complexity, with L4
(adversarial) tasks representing a current frontier (Table IX).

The L1→L4 quality drop of 37.7% has Cohen’s d = 22.9.
Notably, the self-organized Hierarchy Depth (HD) increases
from 1.22 (L1) to 1.56 (L4): the system spontaneously develops deeper organizational structures for more complex tasks,
without any external instruction to do so.
F. Emergent Properties
1) Dynamic Role Specialization: Across all configurations,
RSI converges to zero (Fig. 4). With 8 agents, 5,006 unique

vs. quality across tasks (Sequential = circles, Coordinator = squares). Right:
mechanism of non-participation—38% voluntary (Sequential, endogenous)
vs. 100% coordinator-directed (Coordinator, exogenous). Voluntary abstention
correlates with higher quality (Q = 0.875 vs. 0.767).

role names were observed; with 64 agents, 5,010 (+0.1%).
Agents do not consolidate into fixed positions but reinvent
their specialization for each task. At N = 4, 75% of roles
are unique; at N = 64, 91%, with 54% of role names used
exactly once.
2) Voluntary Self-Abstention: In the Sequential protocol,
agents voluntarily abstain from participation when they assess
their potential contribution as insufficient (Fig. 5). In a representative experiment, 38 out of 60 non-contributing agents
withdrew by their own decision (endogenous), compared to
the Coordinator protocol where all 60 non-contributing agents
were excluded by the coordinator’s directive (exogenous).
Claude demonstrates the highest voluntary abstention rate
(8.6%), while models below the capability threshold show
excessive abstention, leading to incomplete task coverage and
quality degradation.
3) Shallow Self-Organized Hierarchy: The system consistently prefers flat structures. Hierarchy Depth grows from 1.0
(trivial) to only 2.0 when scaling from 4 to 64 agents, indicating that the system organizes into at most two management
layers without external design.
G. Spectral Characteristics of Self-Organization
In the Spectral Hierarchy experiments (Exp3, Series 1–2),
where agents possess evolving skill profiles and are assigned
to subtasks based on competence, spectral analysis revealed
three emergent effects (Fig. 6):
1) Strengthening specialization: The RSI increased from
0.750 (N = 4) to 0.906 (N = 64), a +21% gain—larger
groups develop stronger role differentiation when skill
profiles accumulate.
2) Flat coordination: Hierarchy depth remained at 1.0
across all N —agents spontaneously form horizontal
structures without deepening the hierarchy.
3) Constant connectivity: The spectral gap λ2 ≈ 1.93
remained stable across all group sizes, indicating that the
interaction graph preserves its connectivity properties
during scaling.

B. The Endogeneity Paradox: Why Neither Control Nor Freedom Wins

Fig. 6. Spectral characteristics of self-organization at growing N . Left:
Role Stability Index (RSI) increases from 0.750 to 0.906 (+21%), indicating
stronger specialization in larger groups. Right: the spectral gap λ2 ≈ 1.93
remains stable, indicating constant graph connectivity.

This contrasts with the free-form self-organization experiments (Section IV-F), where RSI → 0 and agents reinvent their
roles from scratch for each task. The difference reflects two
regimes: in structured topologies, agents develop persistent
specialization; in protocol-based self-organization, maximal
role fluidity emerges naturally.
H. Resilience to External Shocks
Self-organizing systems demonstrated rapid recovery from
perturbations. Three shock types were tested on N = 32
agents (Complete topology):
• Random agent removal: quality recovers within 1 iteration;
• Hub agent removal: quality recovers within 1 iteration;
• Model substitution (25% of agents): quality recovers
within 1 iteration.
The Spectral Hierarchy model achieved the highest Resilience Index (RI = 0.959) with zero quality variance
(σQ = 0.000), followed by Sparse Graph (RI = 0.919) and
Mean-Field (RI = 0.844).
Adaptation time (Tadapt ) improves with system size: 0.7 →
1.5 → 3.0 adaptation speed as N increases, suggesting that
larger self-organizing systems heal faster.
V. D ISCUSSION
A. Vertical vs. Horizontal Intelligence: Both Are Necessary
Our results reveal a fundamental interplay in AI system
design. Advances in vertical intelligence—making individual agents smarter through self-improvement [10], scaling,
and fine-tuning—and advances in horizontal intelligence—
designing how groups of agents coordinate—are both essential. A strong model without the right protocol is like an
orchestra without sheet music; the right protocol without a
capable model is like sheet music without musicians. The
two ingredients are multiplicative, not additive: among strong
models, protocol choice explains 44% of quality variation
(Sequential vs. Shared on the same model) while model choice
explains ∼ 14% (Claude vs. GLM-5 on the same protocol).
We see these directions as complementary: stronger models
amplify the benefits of self-organizing protocols, and better
protocols unlock more of each model’s potential.

The superiority of the Sequential protocol can be understood through the information each agent receives. Sequential
provides factual, task-specific, accumulated information: each
agent observes what predecessors actually did for this particular task. This is informationally superior to:
• Intentions (Broadcast): may change between rounds;
• Historical patterns (Shared): may not apply to the current
task;
• A single agent’s plan (Coordinator): limited by one
agent’s judgment.
The analogy is to a sports draft: each team selects knowing
all previous picks, naturally filling complementary positions
without central planning. The paradox is that minimal structure
enables maximal emergence—one simple constraint (fixed
ordering) unlocks spontaneous role differentiation, voluntary
abstention, and mission alignment that no amount of explicit
design achieves.
C. Role as Emergent Function, Not Pre-Assigned Label
The near-zero RSI challenges the fundamental assumption
underlying most multi-agent LLM architectures—that agents
should have fixed roles. For LLM agents, a “role” is not a position in an organizational chart but a computational function
activated by task context. Unlike human organizations, where
role switching incurs retraining costs and cognitive overhead,
an LLM agent transitions from architect to analyst at zero
switching cost. Pre-assigning fixed roles to agents—whether
framed as organizational positions or agent role descriptions—
is an anti-pattern that replicates human limitations onto entities
that lack them.
D. Constitutional Framework for AI Organizations
Self-organization requires boundaries: the Shared protocol
(near-total autonomy) produced the worst results (Q = 0.503),
while Sequential (bounded autonomy) produced the best (Q =
0.724 pilot; Q = 0.875 at N = 16). We propose a three-ring
constitutional framework:
Ring 1 (Immutable Core—human only): Mission, values,
the right to self-abstention. Errors cascade system-wide.
Ring 2 (Standards—human + system): Metrics, governance, audit. The system proposes; humans approve.
Ring 3 (Protocols—autonomous): Coordination parameters, batch sizes, thresholds. Full system autonomy with A/B
testing.
The principle: the closer to “why,” the more human control;
the closer to “how,” the more system autonomy.
E. Implications: Mission, Protocol, Model—Not Pre-Assigned
Roles
Our findings yield a practical recipe for deploying autonomous multi-agent systems. Instead of assigning roles and
writing instructions, practitioners should:
1) Define mission and values, not role assignments. An
LLM agent is not constrained by a physical body or

8

fixed skill set—pre-assigning it a role replicates human
limitations onto entities that lack them. The system
achieves Mission Relevance 4.00/4.00 when given a
mission and freedom, not when given a role description.
2) Choose the right protocol. Among capable models,
protocol choice explains 44% of quality variation (Sequential vs. Shared, same model, same tasks). The
protocol is the amplifier of collective capability.
3) Invest in model quality, not agent quantity. Scaling
from 64 to 256 agents yields no quality improvement
(p = 0.61) at 4.6× cost. The quality spread between
models reaches 174%—the “musician” matters more
than the number of seats.
4) Combine models, don’t pick one. DeepSeek achieves
95% of Claude’s quality at 24× lower cost. Strong
models for L3–L4, efficient models for L1–L2. No single
model dominates all dimensions.
F. Limitations
1) LLM-as-judge evaluation. All quality assessments rely
on LLM judges (GPT-4o, GPT-5.4) rather than human
evaluators. While the multi-criteria decomposition and
strict model separation mitigate self-evaluation bias,
LLM judges may introduce systematic biases (e.g., preference for verbose responses). A human evaluation study
on a representative subset (50–100 tasks) is a priority for
future validation.
2) Judge model change. The judge model changed between series (GPT-4o → GPT-5.4). All within-series
comparisons use the same judge, preserving internal validity, but absolute Q values are not directly comparable
across series. Cross-judge calibration on a shared subset
is planned as follow-up.
3) Synthetic tasks. All tasks are synthetically generated
to enable controlled comparison. While designed to
mirror real-world complexity across four levels (L1–
L4), validation on established benchmarks or authentic
business workflows would strengthen external validity.
4) Sequential latency. The Sequential protocol has O(N )
latency, which may be prohibitive at very large scale.
Batched Sequential variants (Section VI) are a promising
mitigation.
5) API stability. API-based experiments depend on
provider stability. Some models experienced ratelimiting that reduced task completion rates, introducing
potential selection bias.
6) Multiple comparisons. Multiple statistical tests were
performed without formal correction. However, the primary findings (Sequential vs. Shared: p < 0.0001; Sequential vs. Coordinator: p < 0.001 across three models)
have p-values sufficiently small that they remain significant under Bonferroni correction for the number of
comparisons reported (αcorrected = 0.05/20 = 0.0025).
VI. F UTURE W ORK
Several directions extend this research:

1) Validation on real-world tasks. The current experiment
uses synthetically generated tasks designed to mirror
real-world complexity. A natural next step is deploying Sequential self-organization on authentic business
workflows—regulatory analysis, strategic planning, incident response—to validate whether the endogeneity
paradox holds in production environments.
2) Batched Sequential for reduced latency. The Sequential protocol’s O(N ) latency becomes a bottleneck
at large N . A batched variant—where groups of K
agents work in parallel, then the next group observes all
previous outputs—could preserve the informational advantage of Sequential while achieving O(N/K) latency.
This represents a promising middle ground between
Sequential’s quality and Broadcast’s speed.
3) Bio-inspired coordination protocols. Four additional
protocols inspired by biological coordination mechanisms (Morphogenetic, Clonal, Stigmergic, Ripple) have
been tested in preliminary experiments and will be
reported in a forthcoming companion paper. Early results suggest that Ripple (wave-based information propagation) achieves quality comparable to Sequential on
adversarial tasks while permitting greater parallelism.
4) Constitutional governance in practice. The three-ring
constitutional framework proposed in this paper is currently a theoretical model. Testing it as a live governance
mechanism—where Ring 3 protocols are autonomously
optimized by the system via A/B testing while Ring 1
mission constraints remain human-controlled—would
validate the framework’s practical viability.
5) Combining vertical and horizontal advances. Our
results and recent work on self-improving agents [10]
suggest a multiplicative relationship between model capability and coordination protocol. A compelling next
experiment would deploy self-improving agents within
a Sequential coordination framework to test whether
vertical and horizontal intelligence gains compound.
VII. C ONCLUSION
This paper presents the largest systematic study of coordination in multi-agent LLM systems, spanning over 25,000 task
runs across 8 models, 4–256 agents, 8 protocols, and 4 complexity levels. Our central contribution is the discovery of the
endogeneity paradox: optimal coordination emerges not from
maximal control or maximal autonomy, but from a hybrid that
provides minimal structural scaffolding (fixed ordering) while
enabling full role autonomy (endogenous specialization). In
a controlled comparison, the Sequential protocol outperforms
fully autonomous coordination by 44% (Cohen’s d = 1.86,
p < 0.0001); at scale (N = 16, L3), it reaches Q = 0.875,
outperforming centralized coordination by 14% (p < 0.001).
We demonstrate that both protocol choice and model capability are critical design decisions: among strong models,
protocol variation accounts for 44% of quality differences
while model variation accounts for ∼ 14%; but neither alone
suffices, and scaling team size beyond 64 agents yields no
improvement (p = 0.61). The system exhibits emergent

9

properties—dynamic role invention (RSI → 0), voluntary selfabstention, spectral stability (λ2 ≈ 1.93), and spontaneous
hierarchy formation—that are reproduced across both closedsource and open-source models. Open-source models achieve
95% of closed-source quality at 24× lower cost, validating the
viability of multi-model strategies.
The practical recipe is simple: give agents a mission, a
protocol, and a capable model—not a pre-assigned role. Selforganization will do the rest.
